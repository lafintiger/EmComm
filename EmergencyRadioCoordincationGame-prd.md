# **Emergency Radio Coordination Game – PRD and Training Design**

## **1. Overview**

**Emergency Radio Coordination** is a live-action communication and coordination game designed to teach participants how to operate under pressure, prioritize resources, and communicate effectively using radio systems.
It is part disaster simulation, part strategy challenge, and part teamwork exercise.

Players act as citizens, responders, and specialists in a community recovering from a crisis where communication networks are partially down.
The only way to find people, deliver aid, and coordinate support is through radio contact and smart decision-making.

This activity trains:

* Radio communication discipline
* Emergency coordination and prioritization
* Situational awareness and decision timing
* Team adaptability and leadership

It’s built to be scalable — ideal for families, classrooms, CERT teams, or full community drills.

## **2. Learning Goals**

By the end of play, participants should:

1. **Understand basic radio communication protocols** (call signs, message brevity, over/clear, priorities).
2. **Demonstrate resource coordination under time pressure.**
3. **Apply situational awareness** to manage priorities and movement.
4. **Reflect on communication accuracy and decision quality** during debrief.

The game aligns with FEMA’s **ICS communication concepts**, CERT coordination principles, and **ARRL emergency operation protocols**.

## **3. Scenario Context**

### **Base Scenario**

A major storm has knocked out parts of the power grid and disrupted cell networks.
People are stranded in different areas — each with something someone else needs.
The goal: **Find who you’re looking for and get needed supplies delivered safely.**

### **Variant Options (for organizers)**

* **Earthquake:** Road damage, impassable routes, and trapped individuals.
* **Flood:** Supplies isolated by rising water, need for medical evacuation.
* **Wildfire:** Urgent evacuation and triage coordination.

---

## **4. Gameplay Overview**

### **Setup**

* 3 primary locations (can be three rooms, outdoor zones, or distant landmarks ~100 yards apart).
* Each location starts with 2+ players.
* Each player receives a **Role Card** containing:

  1. Who they are (name, profession)
  2. Who they are looking for
  3. What they have
  4. What they need
  5. Their starting location number (1, 2, or 3)

### **Core Objective**

* **Find your target** (person you’re looking for).
* **Deliver or obtain** your needed item.
* **Coordinate movements and priorities** through radio communication.

### **Win Condition**

When:

* All players have connected with the people they’re seeking, and
* All “needs” have been met through proper transfers.

Time and efficiency are scored.

## **6. Example Role Cards**

Each card includes:

| Field                 | Description              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Name / Profession** | Identity and skillset    |

🧩 **Design Note:**

* No one starts in the same place as the person or item they need.
* Each link in the chain creates dependencies that require movement and radio coordination.
* Organizers can scale the table based on player count.

## **7. Scenario Sheet Example**

### **Scenario Title:** *Storm Aftermath*

**Date/Time:** 48 hours after severe thunderstorm impact
**Situation:** Communications down, limited fuel, and rising medical needs.
**Objective:** Restore community coordination and deliver critical supplies.
**Special Rules:**

* Players must physically move between locations.
* Radio use limited to 2 minutes per team per round.
* Decisions and movements occur every 10 minutes.

---

## **8. Communication Protocol Sheet (Example)**

| Step | Action                                                                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Identify your call sign and location. (“This is Morales at Location 1.”)          |
| 2    | Request or transmit information clearly. (“Looking for Patel, does anyone copy?”) |
| 3    | Wait for acknowledgment. (“Copy that, Location 3 here, Patel is with us.”)        |
| 4    | Confirm movements. (“Roger. Morales moving from 1 to 3.”)                         |
| 5    | Close properly. (“Morales clear.”)                                                |

**Facilitator Tip:**
Judges can note any missed protocol steps as “infractions” for scoring impact.

---

## **9. Game Mechanics**

### **Movement**

* Movement is **physical** between locations.
* Players decide whether to move or stay each round.
* If two people move toward each other simultaneously, they may **pass each other** — causing delays.

### **Timing**

* Each round = 10–15 minutes (adjustable).
* Facilitators can use a visible timer or bell for turn changes.
* Total session typically runs **45–90 minutes**.

### **Priority Rules**

* Some players (like doctors or mechanics) may be needed by more than one person.
* Organizers assign **priority flags** for time-sensitive needs (e.g., “Medical in 10 min or fail condition”).

## **10. Scoring and Metrics**

| Category                          | Description                                  | Points / Evaluation   |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Completion Time**               | Total minutes to fulfill all goals           | Faster = Higher score |
| **Radio Discipline**              | Proper protocol, clarity, efficiency         | +10 per perfect round |
| **Team Coordination**             | Ability to relay info and avoid interference | +10                   |
| **Decision Quality**              | Logical prioritization and movement          | +5 per correct call   |
| **Missed Protocols / Collisions** | Overlaps, missed messages, confusion         | -5 each               |
| **High-Priority Success**         | Delivered urgent aid (e.g., medical)         | +20 bonus             |

Facilitators tally scores per team or globally.
Optional leaderboard: rank by coordination efficiency.

---

## **11. Debrief & Reflection**

After the game:

* Gather all teams for a 15–30 min debrief.
* Review metrics (time, accuracy, radio discipline).
* Discuss:

  * What communication strategies worked?
  * Where confusion arose and why?
  * How priorities were determined.
  * Real-world parallels (CERT, ICS, ham radio nets).

Facilitators can print **After-Action Sheets** for notes.

## **13. Technical Appendix: Role Generation Logic**

### **Pseudocode for Role Table Generator**

```python
# Basic logic for creating role assignments

players = [list_of_player_names]
locations = [1, 2, 3]
professions = ["Doctor", "Mechanic", "Technician", "Nurse", "Teacher", "Mayor", "Volunteer"]
items = ["Water", "Insulin", "Batteries", "First Aid", "Food", "Fuel", "Blankets"]

# Step 1: Randomly assign professions and starting locations
assign profession, location to each player

# Step 2: Assign "Has" item randomly
# Step 3: Assign "Needs" ensuring it's not available at same starting location
# Step 4: Assign "Looking For" ensuring target not at same location
# Step 5: Verify all "Need" items exist in pool and all "Looking For" targets are reachable

# Step 6: Output role cards
print_table(players, professions, has, needs, looking_for, location)
```

## **14. Facilitator Notes**

* **Preparation Time:** ~30–45 minutes
* **Ideal Group Size:** 6–18 participants
* **Space Requirements:** 3 physically separated zones
* **Recommended Duration:** 60–90 minutes including debrief

### **Safety & Accessibility**

* Ensure physical movement areas are safe and marked.
* Allow verbal movement if physical access is limited.
* Encourage inclusion and rotate radio use for practice.

### **Scaling Options**

* Fewer than 6 players: reduce to 2 locations.
* Larger groups: expand to 4+ locations and more roles.
* Family version: simplify communication rules, keep objectives cooperative.

## **15. Summary**

This game turns emergency communication training into a living, breathing simulation — a test of teamwork, timing, and radio skill.
It works equally well as a **learning lab**, **team-building exercise**, or **disaster preparedness workshop**.

The **Emergency Radio Coordination Game** is adaptable, expandable, and deeply engaging — preparing participants to not only pass messages, but to **connect communities** when it matters most.
